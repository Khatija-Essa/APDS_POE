# README: Customer International Payments Portal

## Overview

This project focuses on building a secure **Customer International Payments Portal** for an internal banking system. The portal will manage sensitive customer data, international payments, and bank transactions with a strong emphasis on security and compliance. The solution includes a **React** or **Angular** frontend and a backend **API** that ensures secure customer interaction and seamless processing of payments through **SWIFT**.

### Purpose

The portal allows customers to register and execute international payments, while employees can review and process these payments for **SWIFT** transfers. The primary objective is to maintain high levels of security, ease of use, and regulatory compliance throughout the system.

## Key Features

### Customer Features

1. **Registration**:
   - Customers must provide their full name, ID number, account number, and password to register.
   - Passwords are securely hashed and salted to safeguard against unauthorized access.
   - Registration forms are protected using whitelisted **RegEx** patterns to prevent injection attacks and data breaches.

2. **Login**:
   - Customers log in using their username, account number, and password.
   - **RegEx**-based input validation ensures that only valid data is accepted.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/Customer-International-Payments-Portal.git

Here's the content formatted for a GitHub README.md file:


## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React** or **Angular** for the customer and employee interfaces.
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structure and design.
- **Bootstrap** or **Material UI** for responsive and accessible design.

### Backend API:
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for handling server-side logic and API requests.
- **MongoDB** or **MySQL** for customer and transaction data storage.

### Security:
- **Password Hashing and Salting**: Passwords are secured using **bcrypt** or similar hashing libraries.
- **Regex Validation**: All input fields are whitelisted using **RegEx** patterns to prevent invalid or harmful data.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: All communication between the client and server is encrypted.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are used for secure authentication and session management.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/Customer-International-Payments-Portal.git

2. Install Dependencies: After cloning the repository, navigate to the frontend and backend directories to install all necessary dependencies.

cd frontend
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install


3. Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in both the frontend and backend directories to store sensitive configuration values such as:

Database credentials

API keys

JWT secret

SSL certificate paths


4. Run the Application:

Start the frontend:

cd frontend
npm start

Start the backend:

cd backend
npm start

API Endpoints

Customer API:

POST /api/register - Register a new customer by providing the necessary personal information.

POST /api/login - Log in to the portal with a username, account number, and password.

Security Best Practices

1. Password Handling:

Passwords are hashed and salted before storage using bcrypt or a similar library to ensure data security.

2. Data Validation:
All user inputs are validated using RegEx patterns, protecting against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other malicious data entry.

3. Encryption:
All communications between the frontend and backend are encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring that no sensitive data is transmitted in plain text.
Sensitive data such as payment information is encrypted when stored in the database to comply with data protection regulations.

4. Session Management:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used to securely manage user authentication and sessions, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the portal.

Testing and Deployment

1. Unit Testing:

Implement unit tests for both frontend and backend components using testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha to ensure the reliability and integrity of the system.
